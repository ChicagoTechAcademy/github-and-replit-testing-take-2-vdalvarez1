All you need to do for this assignment is to write your name where it says "name" on line 5.

In order to actually run the code, you have to hit Run at the top.
This COMPILES YOUR CODE.
This does not actually RUN the code.

After you have compiled the code, 
in the Terminal at the bottom, type in "java main" (without the quotation marks)

The "java" command tells the computer to run the file you put after it.

So you have to pay attention to the file name!
